My first full project
## Lore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game takes place in the era of the Crusades in the early 12th century. The main character's name is Ulf Jord, who comes from noble families. During his lifetime, Ulf, using his origin, sinned. For this reason, he was not respected by bishops and other priests. Once reasoning with himself, the main character comes to the conclusion that life is not infinite. Is it too early for Charon to visit him? Charon is a carrier of the souls of the dead across the River Styx. For this reason, Ulf decides to atone for his sins and carry the banner of the cross to the East. At the same time and become famous. <br> <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, death comes at the wrong time, on the way to Jerusalem, our hero dies of smallpox.
Once in Limbo, our hero desperately asks Charon for forgiveness, not realizing that it is pointless. <br><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time spent in limbo, Ulf decides to challenge the whole damn hell and kill Satan himself. On the way to his value, the main character goes through all the circles of hell and finally defeats the very lord of fire "The Devil".
